<h2>tbForm</h2>
<strong>(directive)</strong>

<p>The `tbForm` directive is the base to create any form powered by Tubular. Define `dataService` and 
`modelKey` to auto-load a record. The `serverSaveUrl` can be used to create a new or update
an existing record.

Please don't bind a controller directly to the `tbForm`, Angular will throw an exception. If you want
to extend the form behavior put a controller in a upper node like a div.

The `save` method can be forced to update a model against the REST service, otherwise if the Model
doesn't detect any change will ignore the save call.</p>
